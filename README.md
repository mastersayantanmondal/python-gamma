Snake game made on python
This code creates a basic snake game where the snake grows longer when it eats the food and ends when it hits the boundaries or itself.
You can run this code, and it should open a window displaying the game.
Use the arrow keys to control the snake's direction. 
Have fun playing around with it and customizing it further!
